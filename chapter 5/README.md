## Description of the Domain Model and its Invariants

According to the Domain Model, each System will be controlled by an employee at the headquaters,
with their Contact details and could play the Role of either Administrator or Control Officer.
The Administrator job is to add all new clients and the vehicle that they have rented or remove the client
which has returned his or her car.

The clients that have registered on the system will be able to rent a vehicle from their home, because all their details
will be stored in the database. If a client rents a car the condition will be checked before the car is handed in so
if any thing happens they will be charged for the damages.

The payments will be made electronicly no cash due to the fact that a credit card is needed so in case of damages
an auto deduction will be done for the damages.

The client will have the option to choose their engine size and can either take an hatchback, coupe or a sedan
that suits them best.
